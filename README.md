# 42cursus: get next line
### üî•Reading a line from a fd is way too tediousüî•
</div>

> This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor. This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection,
but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: static
variables.
